## Proposal Abstract
MeshNet is an efficient neural network architecture for image segmentation, which can provide results comparable to freesurfer output in a fraction of the time. This project involves integrating an end-to-end computation for MeshNet segmentation in docker, and integrating this computation into the BrainForge backend and frontend.

## About the Project
### Umbrella Project
* BrainForge
### Emphasis:
* Engineering
### Expected Background
* Undergraduate friendly. Familiarity with python is recommended.
### Primary Point of Contact
* Brad Baker (bbaker43@gsu.edu)
### Supervisor
* Jeremy Bockholt (jbockholt@gsu.edu)
## References and External Resources
* brainforge.rs.gsu.edu 
## Estimated Timelines
* 2-3 months (summer project)

## Possible Deliverables
* Singularity container which wraps MeshNet 
* Demonstration of the container on a small study + comparison with freesurfer
