## Proposal Abstract
Information-theoretic measures can be useful for providing insight into how deep neural networks learn on different data sets. One possible application in data science involves measuring the mutual information between hidden layers and the input and output spaces, and how this differs on Auto-Encoders trained on different groups of data. For neuroimaging, we may be interested in visualizing the trajectories of an auto-encoder trained on people diagnosed with schizophrenia vs those who are not.
