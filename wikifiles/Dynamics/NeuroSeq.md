## Proposal Abstract
There are many data sets with functional MRI which have some corresponding associated time-series data. How can functional MRI be used to predict this corresponding time series? For example, using the Forrest Gump data set, can we create a Seq2Seq style model which can predict dialogue from the movie, eye movements, or which can provide reliable object detection on stills from the film? We could use ICA timecourses, FNC state sequences, or raw fMRI as input to one end of the model. Can we do the inverse as well? E.g. can we predict neural information such as FNC states, ICA timecourses, or even full fMRI volumes from the movie data?
