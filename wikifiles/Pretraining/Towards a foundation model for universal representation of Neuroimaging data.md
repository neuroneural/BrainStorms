## Proposal Abstract
A foundation model is a large deep learning model trained on a vast quantity of unlabeled data at scale resulting in a model that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks (classification, regression, segmentation, etc). Such model would allow to avoid development of the new model for the task from scratch, facilitate robustness and accelerate analysis on small neuroimaging studies.

## Estimated Timelines
* 2-4 months (summer project / semester project)

## Possible Deliverables
* Implementation of self-supervised and generative models (at least one model) with application to Neuroimaging data (unimodal & multimodal, mostly structural volumetric data, but can be fMRI, DTI, etc.)
* Contribution to open-source neuroimaging package (Currently, it is fusion)
* Exhaustive evaluation: comparison with baselines, data-efficiency,  transfer learning, out-of-distribution generalization, fairness, interpretability, harmonization, underspecification
* Submission to Machine Learning & Deep Learning & Medical Imaging Workshops (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ECCV,  ICCV, MICCAI)
* Submission to Machine Learning & Deep Learning & Medical Imaging Conferences (e.g. IEEE, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, MICCAI, MIDL, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV)
* Submission to Neuroimage & Nature journals
